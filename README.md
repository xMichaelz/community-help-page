# community-help-page
This website simulates a potential community aid network for specific sectors of society, where people can offer and request assistance; in this case, food and medicine. The goal of the site is to make it easier to connect those in need with those who can provide help
#
The page was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap.  
The most interesting part of the site is the “Listings” section, which uses scripts to simulate a database connection through Local Storage. This means storing the information received from the “Offer Help” and “Request Help” forms in a JSON file, and then calling these same constants to use the stored data.  
That information is then transformed so it can be displayed in charts created with Canvas and the Chart.js library.  
This showcases several interesting uses, all focused on JavaScript.
